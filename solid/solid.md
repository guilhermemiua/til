# SOLID Principles

## Single Responsability Principle

"A class should have one, and only one, reason to change."

## Open Closed Principle

"Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification."

## Liskov Substitution Principle

"Subclasses must be able to be substituted by their superclasses."
