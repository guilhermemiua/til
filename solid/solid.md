# SOLID Principles

## Single Responsability Principle

"A class should have one, and only one, reason to change."

## Open Closed Principle

"Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification."

## Liskov Substitution Principle

"Any subclass object should be substitutable for the superclass object from which it is derived."

## Interface Segregation Principle

"States that not client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use."
